# Crewmeister Coding Challenge

This repository contains a Spring Boot application developed as part of a take-home assignment for Crewmeister. The application fetches historical exchange rates (EUR base) from the [Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de) and stores them in a local database.

---

## üöÄ Features Implemented

- Fetch and store exchange rates for all supported currencies from the Bundesbank public API.
- At application startup, a `@PostConstruct` method automatically fetches exchange rates and stores them in the database.
- A scheduled job runs every week at 6 AM to check for new currencies and fetch exchange rates to store them.
- API endpoints to:
    - List supported currencies.
    - Fetch all exchange rates
    - Fetch exchange rates for a given date.
    - Convert foreign currency to EUR for a given date.
- In-memory H2 database used for simplicity.
- If the application restarts and data is lost (due to H2 volatility), an /api/save API is available to re-trigger the data fetch and persist it again.
- Both unit and integration test cases are implemented.
- Dockerized application with Kubernetes support for local development.
- Postman collection included for easy testing of APIs.
- JaCoCo plugin integrated with 90%+ unit test coverage.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Prajakta06021994/crewmeister-coding-challenge.git

cd crewmeister-coding-challenge

üß™ How to Run Locally (Dev Mode)
# Build and run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Once the application starts:
A scheduled job will run automatically.
It fetches exchange rate data from the external API and stores it in the H2 database.
If data is lost (e.g., after restart), you can trigger the fetch manually using the /api/fetch endpoint.
